1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features 
your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:


(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

Features: 
- Equitable Use
Our program adheres to equitable use by ensuring that all users, regardless of their background or financial experience,
can participate in the simulation. The program does not require prior knowledge of investing, making it accessible for 
beginner investors. In the future, we could enhance equity by incorporating multiple language options to support 
non-native English speakers.
- Flexibility in Use
- Simple and Intuitive Use
The interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, with clear navigation and labels for each feature. Users can 
easily find key functionalities such as buying, selling, and tracking their portfolio. In the future, adding 
interactive tutorials or tooltips could further assist first-time users in understanding the program’s features.

- Perceptible Information
- Low Physical Effort
  Using the program requires minimal physical effort, as most actions can be completed with simple mouse clicks. Future enhancements could include keyboard shortcuts or voice-activated commands to further reduce physical effort, making the program more accessible for users with mobility impairments.
- Size and Space for Approach and Use

2. Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license 
your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as 
"people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

Our program is a stock market simulation, so we would market our program towards beginner investors who want to 
practice investing without using their own money. We would also attempt to license our program to specific business
schools who want to offer an interactive hands-on learning experience to students taking finance classes. For example,
the Rotman program has access to RIT (Rotman Interactive Trader), which instructors use in their classes. Additionally, 
we could market the program to online learning platforms that offer courses in personal finance or investing.


3. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your 
discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.

The first embedded ethics module is about user diversity. We believe that our program is equally likely to be used
by all demographics (age, gender, race, education and more). A stock market simulation would help users practice trading
which could help them gain confidence and encourage them to pursue personal trading. This could allow users to gain 
financial stability and improve their financial status. This is important for users of any background, especially for 
minorities who may not know much about trading growing up.

The second embedded ethics module was about individuals with disabilites. [FILL IN]
