1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features 
your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:


(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

Features: 
- Equitable Use
- Flexibility in Use
- Simple and Intuitive Use
- Perceptible Information
- Low Physical Effort
- Size and Space for Approach and Use

2. Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license 
your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as 
"people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

Our program is a stock market simulation, so we would market our program towards beginner investors who want to 
practice investing without using their own money. We would also attempt to license our program to specific business
schools who want to offer an interactive hands-on learning experience to students taking finance classes. For example,
the Rotman program has access to RIT (Rotman Interactive Trader), which instructors use in their classes. 

3. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your 
discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.

The first embedded ethics module is about user diversity. We believe that our program is equally likely to be used
by all demographics (age, gender, race, education and more). A stock market simulation would help users practice trading
which could help them gain confidence and encourage them to pursue personal trading. This could allow users to gain 
financial stability and improve their financial status. This is important for users of any background, especially for 
minorities who may not know much about trading growing up.

The second embedded ethics module was about individuals with disabilites. Our program currently lacks specific features 
designed to address the needs of users with disabilities, such as screen reader compatibility or customizable input 
methods for those with motor impairments. However, it would be possible to develop features like adjustable font sizes, 
keyboard-only navigation, and compatibility with assistive technologies to align with the social model of disability in 
future. These enhancements would align with the social model of disability by addressing design barriers and ensuring 
the program is more inclusive for a diverse range of users. Prioritizing accessibility not only prevents potential harm 
but also promotes equality, as highlighted in the ethics module, by enabling broader access and usability for all 
individuals.
