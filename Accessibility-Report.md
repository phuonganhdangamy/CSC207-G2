1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features 
your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:


(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

Features: 
- Equitable Use
Our program adheres to equitable use by ensuring that all users, regardless of their background or financial experience,
can participate in the simulation. The program does not require prior knowledge of investing, making it accessible for 
beginner investors. In the future, we could enhance equity by incorporating multiple language options to support 
non-native English speakers.

- Flexibility in Use
Our program has flexibility and serves as a bridge to connect the real market with the users. User can choose their 
own trade study styles, experimenting with different trading techniques, such as short-term transactions or long-term 
investments, to suit their learning goals and interests. In the future, we might expand this flexibility by providing 
tools like scenario-based simulations or dashboards for performance monitoring, which would help users refine their 
strategies and get a deeper comprehension of market behavior.

- Simple and Intuitive Use
The interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, with clear navigation and labels for each feature. Users can 
easily find key functionalities such as buying, selling, and tracking their portfolio. In the future, adding 
interactive tutorials or tooltips could further assist first-time users in understanding the program’s features.

- Perceptible Information
The program ensures that stock data, portfolio balances, and profit loss are shown in clearly, hence providing 
perceptible information. To improve perceptible quality of data in the future, we may develop visuals to show charts 
and graphs to help users be able to rapidly interpreting performance and trends. Additionally, to increase information 
accessibility in the future, we might include features like high contrast settings or audio feedback for users who are 
blind or visually impaired.

- Low Physical Effort
Using the program requires minimal physical effort, as most actions can be completed with simple mouse clicks. 
Future enhancements could include keyboard shortcuts or voice-activated commands to further reduce physical effort, 
making the program more accessible for users with mobility impairments.

- Size and Space for Approach and Use
Currently, our program is developed for desktop and laptop users with Java Swing for UI, where font size and ability to 
organize are limited.  In the future, we may make the application mobile-friendly by allowing users to customize 
interface elements and have touch-friendly layouts.

2. Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license 
your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as 
"people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

Our program is a stock market simulation, so we would market our program towards beginner investors who want to 
practice investing without using their own money. We would also attempt to license our program to specific business
schools who want to offer an interactive hands-on learning experience to students taking finance classes. For example,
the Rotman program has access to RIT (Rotman Interactive Trader), which instructors use in their classes. Additionally, 
we could market the program to online learning platforms that offer courses in personal finance or investing.


3. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your 
discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.

The first embedded ethics module is about user diversity. We believe that our program is equally likely to be used
by all demographics (age, gender, race, education and more). A stock market simulation would help users practice trading
which could help them gain confidence and encourage them to pursue personal trading. This could allow users to gain 
financial stability and improve their financial status. This is important for users of any background, especially for 
minorities who may not know much about trading growing up.

The second embedded ethics module was about individuals with disabilites. Our program currently lacks specific features 
that designed for users with disabilities, such as screen reader compatibility or customizable input methods for those 
with motor impairments. However, in order to conform to the social model of disability in the future, features like 
keyboard-only navigation, changeable font sizes, and interoperability with assistive devices could be developed. These 
enhancements would align with the social model of disability by addressing design barriers and ensuring the program is 
more inclusive for a diverse range of users. Prioritizing accessibility not only prevents potential harm but also 
promotes equality, as highlighted in the ethics module, by enabling broader access for all individuals.
